  summary: 'The Go Programming Language'
  description: |
    Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms
    make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and
    networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and
    modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has
    the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection.
    It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
    dynamically typed, interpreted language.
